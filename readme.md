Purpose of this repo is to upload different test files created as I learn Python and other languages. I also keep a daily log (on days I do something) here and will track any further progress on both learning and towards getting a job.

Started on June 09, 2022.

Task List:
- [ ] Complete Python Developer in 2022 Course
- [ ] SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business
- [ ] Tableau 2020 A-Z

I'm having trouble determining what projects to complete or even their scope so to minimize that difficulty I enrolled in some python classes along with a project course to help. I know I do well in an "official" learning environment (or when I feel like I'm in a classroom), so I can manage working in those classes. I've also gone ahead and gotten SQL and Tableau courses too, which I may add to the repository. Here's the current general learning plan:

1. Complete Python Developer in 2022 Course
2. SQL - MySQL for Data Analytics and Business
3. Tableau 2020 A-Z
4. 100 Days of Code (done after the first and during the other courses)

After this, rounding things out with Excel practice should also be good. I feel fine with SQL and Excel since I have working experience with both, but I've already recieved two job rejection emails as of today. Doesn't sting, but I struck much better as an actuary.

I recalibrated my learning priorities today, so I don't just code every day without a general direction, which I can do from time to time. I'm looking at my June 10th entry, which talks about what I should work on to become more advanced and I'm thinking on both PIP and file IO since I need to become more familiar with working with different libraries (along with installing them) and file practice. The [Financial Analysis Coursera code](FinancialAnalysisCoursera.py) I did seems to be a good start for that, since I'm reading in the .csv files and also working with Pandas, so I'll keep going with that course. 

I also went to a data science talk today, which was mainly for networking and just curiosity. I did learn about resources like [Datakind](https://www.datakind.org/) and [all tech is human](https://alltechishuman.org/), which I'll take a longer look at when I have more experience, and it's probably not good to stretch myself out too thin looking too long at everything when I should be focusing on a few things for now.

Uploaded facebook.csv and microsoft.csv for the [Financial Analysis Coursera code](FinancialAnalysisCoursera.py) I was working on. Getting Jupyter notebooks to work and everything was a little tricky for my first time. I figured how to take the 'head' of a table and open the file with the Pandas package, but have not figured mmatplotlib yet. 

I also finished the entirety of course 1 from the Google Data Analystics course. Looking over the rest of the schedule and coursework for the other courses, it's nearly all things I've done before in a school project or professional setting, so I'll keep it on the side if I need something to keep chipping at. Most of the teachings are *really* beginner level, which is what I wasn't looking for. I did like how the course taught me the process that an analyst would work with data and share their conclusions, which matched my experience as an actuary analyst.

On another note, I have been applying to jobs (about 7 so far), and got rejected from my first one already. I think my experience from looking for actuary internships and jobs has calloused me to the "pain" of professional rejection now. Most of the job listings have been for R and SQL / Excel, which I'm pretty comfortable with and have done before at work and my internship. I'm sure I can find a job now if I just set my standards low enough, but I'll keep going to find something that isn't totally wack.

I was a bit busy today, but I started and finished weeks 1 and 2 of the [Google Data Analytics course on Coursera](https://grow.google/certificates/data-analytics/). It seems easy enough to do full time, but I skipped a lot of the non-readings and skimmed through the videos since the material isn't non-intuitive (mind the double negative), and I'm familiar with most of it already. Had a lot of other things to take care of, so that's it for today. 

## June 10, 2022
Got back into python learning again, along with committing any changes I made just to practice with the terminal. Since I'm comfortable with most intro things like loops, I'll take a step further into object oriented programming, which can be found [here](ObjectOrientedPractice.py).

I then watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p15xzjzR9j0) video, so I'd place myself in between beginner - intermediate so far. I should cover though:

1. Mutable vs immutable data types
2. File IO
3. Data structures
4. Lambda functions
5. *args and **kwargs
6. Dunder methods (double underscore methods)
7. PIP
8. Splitting code into modules

## June 09, 2022
Just focusing on learning git today. Got setup with vscode and how to incorporate git so I can push updates instead of uploading the files themselves like a caveman. On another note, it feels good to be learning again, and on things I find interesting. Here are some important commands in case I forget:

```
git pull
git add .
git commit -m ""
git push
```

My head hurt after doing this for a few hours so I took the rest of today off.
