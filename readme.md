Purpose of this repo is to upload different test files created as I learn Python and other languages. I also keep a daily log (on days I do something) here and will track any further progress on both learning and towards getting a job.

Got back into python learning again, along with committing any changes I made just to practice with the terminal. Since I'm comfortable with most intro things like loops, I'll take a step further into object oriented programming. Work done today can be found in the file [here](mttwdevelops/Python-Practice/ObjectOrientedPractice.py).

Just focusing on learning git today. Got setup with vscode and how to incorporate git so I can push updates instead of uploading the files themselves like a caveman. On another note, it feels good to be learning again, and on things I find interesting. Here are some important commands in case I forget:

```
git pull
git add .
git commit -m ""
git push
```

My head hurt after doing this for a few hours so I took the rest of today off.
